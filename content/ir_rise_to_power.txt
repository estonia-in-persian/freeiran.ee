The 1979 Revolution didn't start as a theocracy. It began as a massive, messy coalition.
Leftists, nationalists, intellectuals, and clerics stood together with one goal: getting rid of
the Shah. But the moment the monarchy fell, that unity evaporated. When Ayatollah
Khomeini returned, his faction moved fast to push everyone else out. By the time the
referendum happened a few months later, the choice was binary and the result was
sealed. They used the chaos to install a constitution built around the absolute power of the
clergy.
After returning from exile, Ruhollah Khomeini and his allies moved decisively to
monopolize power. Rather than allowing a pluralistic political system to emerge, they
dismantled rival centers of influence. Revolutionary courts were established almost
immediately. These courts operated without basic due process and issued death
sentences after summary trials. Human rights organizations have documented that
executions began within weeks of the revolution and continued at scale throughout the
early 1980s.
The new constitution formalized clerical rule through the doctrine of Velayat-e Faqih,
placing ultimate authority in the hands of an unelected Supreme Leader. Political power
was removed from public accountability and concentrated within religious and security
institutions. Central among them was the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),
which evolved into a powerful force responsible not only for external defense but for
internal repression and ideological enforcement.
Throughout the 1980s, thousands of political opponents were arrested, tortured, and
executed. Vague charges such as “enmity against God” (moharebeh) or “corruption on
Earth” were routinely used to criminalize dissent. According to Amnesty International,
these executions followed grossly unfair trials and were designed to eliminate opposition
rather than deliver justice.
The most extreme episode came in 1988, when the authorities secretly executed
thousands of political prisoners over the course of a few weeks. Many of those killed were
already serving prison sentences. Families were never informed of burial locations, and
mass graves were concealed or destroyed. Amnesty International has described these
killings as crimes under international law and has repeatedly warned that the lack of
accountability has entrenched a culture of impunity.
Over the next four decades, every major protest movement was met with escalating
violence: student uprisings in 1999, the Green Movement in 2009, nationwide protests in
2017–18, the fuel protests of 2019, the Woman, Life, Freedom uprising in 2022, and the
current wave of protests in 2025–2026. Each time, the response was the same: live
ammunition, mass arrests, torture, televised forced confessions, and executions designed
to terrorize society into submission.
This pattern has been consistently documented by international monitors. Human Rights
Watch has reported the routine use of unlawful lethal force against protesters and
systematic abuse in detention centers. Iran remains one of the world’s leading
executioners. Reporting by the Associated Press and findings from the UN Office of the
High Commissioner for Human Rights show that hundreds of executions are carried out
each year, often following trials that fail to meet international legal standards.
Over time, repression became structural. Independent media was eliminated, political
parties were banned, women were subjected to compulsory veiling enforced through
violence, and civil society was placed under constant surveillance. The system survives
not through legitimacy or consent, but through fear.
The history of the Islamic Republic shows a consistent pattern. Promises of liberation were
followed by the systematic removal of freedoms. Violence was not a reaction to instability.
It was the method used to build and maintain power.
